## 📖 Project Overview  
This project, developed during my Edunet–AICTE Internship, focuses on **analyzing and predicting Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning techniques. The aim is to create awareness about environmental sustainability and leverage AI for green skills.  

Air pollution is a major concern for global health. By building models that predict AQI, policymakers, organizations, and communities can take timely actions to improve air quality and ensure sustainable living.

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Preprocessing** → Cleaning and handling missing values in AQI dataset.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Visualizing pollutant levels and trends.  
3. **Feature Engineering** → Extracting useful parameters for prediction.  
4. **Model Development** → Implementing ML models to predict AQI.  
5. **Result Evaluation** → Comparing performance using accuracy metrics.

## 📊 Results & Insights  
- Identified pollutants most responsible for AQI deterioration.  
- Trained models to predict AQI categories (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.).  
- Highlighted actionable insights to reduce air pollution.  

---

## 🌱 Green Skills Impact  
This project contributes to **SDG Goal 13: Climate Action** by applying AI to environmental challenges. Predicting AQI helps in:  
- Creating awareness of pollution effects.  
- Supporting eco-friendly policies.  
- Encouraging sustainable development.  

---

## 📌 Future Scope  
- Deploy AQI prediction as a **web dashboard/app**.  
- Integrate with **real-time IoT sensors** for live AQI monitoring.  
- Extend to **multiple cities/countries** for comparative studies.
